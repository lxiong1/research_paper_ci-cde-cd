\section{Introduction}

\subsection{Thesis Statement}
The software industry is transforming at a rapid pace to accommodate the dynamic nature of the market and as a result, it continues to struggle to find process-identity with continuous software engineering.

\subsection{Purpose Statement}
Software engineering has for two decades, experimented with the concept of distributing software in faster release cycles; endeavoring to do so without sacrificing reliability and security. To achieve such a goal, there has been a widespread movement in the technical community to advocate for using Agile practices, and in particular: continuous integration, delivery, and deployment. The traditional methods of software development no longer meet the need of businesses that -- now more than ever -- want to proactively engage and retain their customers. The organizational transition to Agile practices demands a large mentality change and require individuals to recognize software as incremental features developed with cross-collaboration of small comprehensive team units, as opposed to large modules developed by siloed units.
